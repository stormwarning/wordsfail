    	<h2>The Story</h2>
  		
    	<p>He was the nerdy web-dev kid, always guzzling 'Rockstar' and I was the pretentious designer (still am). We had desks side by side in the D3 studio and never in a <em>million</em> years did I think I'd now be head over heels for him. He was a part of the Web Team which was eventually moved off Main Campus and into the Kingsway building. We still talked through IM but no longer had coffee walks or office discussions. In early 2010 I took a 6-month Leave to travel around Europe and while I was away, I seemed to talk to him online the most. Talking to him started to feel like home. When I returned home in the summer we immediately started hanging out and he was happy to join me whenever I wanted to go to any of Edmonton's summer events. Our outings together became more and more frequent. By Christmas that year we were together as a couple and I couldn’t be happier that I found love with such a dear friend.</p>
