    	<h2 class="mega">The Story</h2>
  		
    	<p>He was the nerdy web-dev kid, always guzzling energy drinks and she was the pretentious designer (still is). They had desks side by side in the design studio at NAIT and never in a million years did either of them think they’d now be head over heels for each other. He was a part of the Web Team which was eventually moved off NAIT Main Campus and into another building. They still talked through instant messaging but no longer had coffee walks or office discussions. In early 2010 she took a 6-month leave to travel around Europe and while she was away, they talked all the time online. For her, talking to him started to feel like home and and for him, well, he couldn&#8217;t wait to start travelling again. When she returned home in the summer they immediately started hanging out and together they attended many of Edmonton&#8217;s summer events, his camera always in tow. Their outings together became more and more frequent and by Christmas that year they were together as a couple and couldn&#8217;t be happier that they found love with such a dear friend.</p>
